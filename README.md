Founder_Hub is a full-stack platform built with Next.js and Sanity designed to discover startups, share blog posts, and pitch new ideas. This project was my first full-stack development experience, created while learning from YouTube tutorials and hands-on experimentation. Through this project, I gained practical knowledge of Next.js API routing, SSR, SSG, ISR, partial rendering, headless CMS integration, and content management.
